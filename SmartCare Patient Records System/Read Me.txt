modify existing records, remove patients, and view the list of patients who
visited the clinic today.

Files and Directories
---------------------
1. walkIn.cpp - Main file that handles patient record management.
2. Patient.h - Header file defining the Patient class and its methods.
3. List.h - Header file defining the List class for managing a collection of Patient records.

Dependencies
------------
- Standard C++ library.
